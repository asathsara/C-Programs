/*
 * Program: Hello, World!
 * ----------------------
 * This is a basic C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
 * It serves as an introduction to C programming by demonstrating:
 * - The use of the `#include <stdio.h>` header for input/output operations.
 * - The `main()` function as the entry point of the program.
 * - The `printf()` function for displaying text on the screen.
 * - The `return 0;` statement, which indicates successful program execution.
