# C-Programs

This repository contains a collection of C programs demonstrating various concepts and functionalities in C programming. Below is a list of all the programs with their descriptions:

1. **[program1.c](program1.c)**: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console. A basic introduction to C programming.
2. **[program2.c](program2.c)**: Demonstrates character printing and displays a predefined year.
3. **[program3.c](program3.c)**: A simple addition calculator that takes two integers as input and displays their sum.
4. **[program4.c](program4.c)**: Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using a mathematical formula.
5. **[program5.c](program5.c)**: Evaluates and prints the results of different mathematical expressions to demonstrate operator precedence.
6. **[program6.c](program6.c)**: Demonstrates the use of increment and decrement operators in C.
7. **[program7.c](program7.c)**: Explains the use of logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) with examples.
8. **[program8.c](program8.c)**: Evaluates various logical expressions using relational and logical operators.
9. **[program9.c](program9.c)**: Calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on user-provided radius.
10. **[program10.c](program10.c)**: Prints all odd numbers from 1 to 20 using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
11. **[program11.c](program11.c)**: Sums numbers entered by the user until a non-positive number is entered.
12. **[program12.c](program12.c)**: Displays the name of a month based on user input (1-12) using a `switch` statement.
13. **[program13.c](program13.c)**: Prints a solid rectangle pattern of asterisks (`*`) with 5 rows and 10 columns.
14. **[program14.c](program14.c)**: Prints a hollow rectangle pattern of asterisks (`*`) with 5 rows and 10 columns.
15. **[program15.c](program15.c)**: Prints a right-angled triangle pattern of asterisks (`*`).
16. **[program16.c](program16.c)**: Prints a centered right-angled triangle pattern (half-pyramid) of asterisks (`*`).
17. **[program17.c](program17.c)**: Prints an inverted right-angled triangle pattern of asterisks (`*`).
18. **[program18.c](program18.c)**: Checks if a given year is a leap year, with input validation.
19. **[program19.c](program19.c)**: Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
20. **[program20.c](program20.c)**: Calculates the distance between two points using the distance formula.

Each program is self-contained and includes comments explaining its logic and functionality.
